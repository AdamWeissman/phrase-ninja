This one here, flashcard_with_score accomplishes two things.

It reassigns the score_id on the phrase.
It also adds points to the familiarity_score/rank on the phrase.

When a certain number of points are exceeded, it is dropped from the cycle (studying_now is set to false)

Upon submission, the user is cycled back to flashcard_first_view where logic in the controller causes:
only the phrases that are true to appear.  In addition to phrases that render on this page, the controller checks:
-studying_now
-familiarity_score (it will shuffle all scores below a certain threshhold...) also, if a score_id is set to something
that is outside the scope of what is currently set to true, it will change the value to false.
